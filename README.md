========================================================
DDoS:
Distributed Denial Of Service Attack
Its basically when a api ex. https://api.booter.com/apikey etc send packets to an internet protocol or IP your ip is nerver safe from DDoS attacks unless you use and OVH/NFO/VPN/CF-WARP There is a cf warp in this pack (which is my fav to use) but any way the api send packets to an IP and overloads it causing it down shutdown.
=============================================================================
How to Setup CF-WARP
run the wireguard installer package and wait... one that is installed open wire guard and click import file and select the cf-warp file that came with it and click Activate and boom cloudflare DDoS protection you have. So you can relax and not worry about skids.
===============================================================================

Whats an IP Pinger???
An ip pinger takes an Internet Protocal (IP) and checks if it is online so for example open the pinger and type the ip 1.1.1.1 and hit enter as you can see something like this will pop up
=============================================
Reply from 1.1.1.1: bytes=32 time=23ms TTL=59

Reply from 1.1.1.1: bytes=32 time=22ms TTL=59
Reply from 1.1.1.1: bytes=32 time=20ms TTL=59
=============================================
If it replys like this the IP is online now if it says this
============================================
Pinging 192.116.116.1 with 32 bytes of data:
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.

============================================
This means the IP is offline now if this ip was your target you did a good job.
===============================================================================
